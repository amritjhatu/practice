    <p>
      The <b>tiger</b> (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the
      genus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera">Panthera</a> native
      to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a
      long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is
      traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some
      recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers
      of the Sunda Islands.

      Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous
      and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the Russian Far East and
      Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the
      Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and
      preys mainly on ungulates, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly
      solitary life and occupies home ranges, defending these from individuals
      of the same sex. The range of a male tiger overlaps with that of multiple
      females with whom he mates. Females give birth to usually two or three
      cubs that stay with their mother for about two years. When becoming
      independent, they leave their mother's home range and establish their own.
